# imagination-sud
A simple Single User Dungeon game written in Java

ABOUT

This is my BS Software Development degree capstone project. It is a computer game called Imagination written in Java using the JavaFX 8 GUI Framework. It is a 2D graphics Single User Dungeon crawler with supplementary text to describe actions.

The game is called Imagination because my idea for the story is it is a dream world of the playerâ€™s imagination. There will be a primary stat called imagination that will alter the game world.  However, at this point most of this only exists in my "imagination" :).  Presented here is a simple dungeon crawler game which is a starting point for this broader vision.

One cool thing about the dungeon is it procedurally generated with a random number and location of doors per room. This means that the dungeon layout will be unique for each new game. It is also theoretically infinite in size.

The goal of the game is simple: get as far from the starting room as possible without dying. There will be many enemies to fend off. Beware, the farther you get from the starting room, the more powerful the enemies become!

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

The game was tested on a 64 bit installation of Windows 7 Home Premium. It is an x64 application and will not run on a 32 bit OS. You need to run it on a Windows OS. It is a Java program, but you don't need to have Java installed because it is bundled in the executable.

RUNNING THE GAME

To run the game download and unzip the file Imagination_x64.zip located in the following project folder:

Imagination/src/executable/

Then click on the Imagination.exe file located in the unzipped Imagination_x64 root directory to run.

Documentation and mp4 video tutorials are available in the "documentation" directory at the root of the repository.

Have fun!
